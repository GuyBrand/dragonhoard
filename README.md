Goals
-----

Aiming to be the first Open Source GoLang e-commerce platform, we are expanding even what an e-commerce platform even is. Our goal is to provide a highly customizable template driven inventory management system, with rfid tag integration, a customizable point of sale, a streamlined ticketing system to track the product from creation to completion, a customer relation management tool, all with a web front end that is completely themeable.

Business Model
--------------

We are using the Wordpress business model here:

* You are free to take and install this on your own server,
* Or you can use our service and avoid the hassle.

Standalone
----------

This is the free version. We'll provide documentation to get it up and running on your own server for you, but offer no support other than upgrades to the code and standard issues on github.

Service
-------

Our service will provide everything you need online with package options to have a maintained server locally, et al.
